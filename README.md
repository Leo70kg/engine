# OpenArena Engine 
This project is a fork of OpenArena with specific changes to the client and server.
Some of the major features currently implemented are:

  * SDL 2 backend
  * OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound
    quality)
  * Full x86_64 support on Linux
  * VoIP support, both in-game and external support through Mumble.
  * MinGW compilation support on Windows and cross compilation support on Linux
  * AVI video capture of demos
  * Much improved console autocompletion
  * Persistent console history
  * Colorized terminal output
  * Optional Ogg Vorbis support
  * Much improved QVM tools
  * Support for various esoteric operating systems
  * cl_guid support
  * HTTP/FTP download redirection (using cURL)
  * Multiuser support on Windows systems (user specific game data
    is stored in "%APPDATA%\OpenArena")
  * PNG support
  * Many, many bug fixes

The original id software readme that accompanied the Q3 source release has been
renamed to id-readme.txt so as to prevent confusion. Please refer to the
website for updated status.



## Building on Ubuntu or Debian Linux ##


Install the build dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libogg-dev zlib1g-dev libvorbis-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev libxmp-dev
$ sudo apt-get install clang
$ git clone https://github.com/suijingfeng/engine.git
$ cd engine
$ make
```

## Building on Windows 7 or 10 ##

To build 64-bit binaries, follow these instructions:

1. Install msys2 from https://msys2.github.io/ , following the instructions there.
2. Start "MinGW 64-bit" from the Start Menu, NOTE: NOT MSYS2.
3. Install mingw-w64-x86\_64, make, git tools:
```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc make git
```
4. Grab latest openarena source code from github and compile. Note that in msys2, your drives are linked as folders in the root directory: C:\ is /c/, D:\ is /d/, and so on.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/suijingfeng/engine.git
cd engine
make ARCH=x86_64
```
5. Find the executables and dlls in build/release-mingw64-x86\_64 . 



## RUN ##
First, download the map packages from http://openarena.ws/download.php
Second, extract the data files at
~/.OpenArena/ (on linux) 
C:\Users\youname\AppData\Roaming\OpenArena\ (on windows)


```sh
$ cd /build/release-linux-x86_64/
$ ./openarena.x86_64
```


## Switching renderers ##


This feature is disabled by default. If you wish to enable it, set USE\_RENDERER\_DLOPEN=1 in Makefile.
This allow for build modular renderers and select the renderer at runtime rather than compiling into one binary.
When you start OpenArena, you can pass the name of the dynamic library to load. 

Example:

```sh
# new vulkan renderer backend, under developing, work in ubuntu 18.04
# windows platform not test now, have small issues with \minimize

$ ./openarena.x86_64 +set cl_renderer vulkan

# OR type following command in the poll down console

\cl_renerer vulkan
\vid_restart

# Enable renderergl2:
$ ./openarena.x86_64 +set cl_renderer opengl2

# Enable the renderergl1:
$ ./openarena.x86_64 +set cl_renderer opengl1

# Enable the default OpenArena renderer:
# This renderer module is similiar to the renderergl1 code.
$ ./openarena.x86_64 +set cl_renderer openarena
```



# README for Developers

## pk3dir

ioquake3 has a useful new feature for mappers. Paths in a game directory with
the extension ".pk3dir" are treated like pk3 files. This means you can keep
all files specific to your map in one directory tree and easily zip this
folder for distribution.

## 64bit mods

If you wish to compile external mods as shared libraries on a 64bit platform,
and the mod source is derived from the id Q3 SDK, you will need to modify the
interface code a little. Open the files ending in _syscalls.c and change
every instance of int to intptr_t in the declaration of the syscall function
pointer and the dllEntry function. Also find the vmMain function for each
module (usually in cg_main.c g_main.c etc.) and similarly replace the return
value in the prototype with intptr_t (arg0, arg1, ...stay int).

Add the following code snippet to q_shared.h:

    #ifdef Q3_VM
    typedef int intptr_t;
    #else
    #include <stdint.h>
    #endif

Note if you simply wish to run mods on a 64bit platform you do not need to
recompile anything since by default Q3 uses a virtual machine system.

## Creating mods compatible with Q3 1.32b

If you're using this package to create mods for the last official release of
Q3, it is necessary to pass the commandline option '-vq3' to your invocation
of q3asm. This is because by default q3asm outputs an updated qvm format that
is necessary to fix a bug involving the optimizing pass of the x86 vm JIT
compiler.

## Creating standalone games

Have you finished the daunting task of removing all dependencies on the Q3
game data? You probably now want to give your users the opportunity to play
the game without owning a copy of Q3, which consequently means removing cd-key
and authentication server checks. In addition to being a straightforward Q3
client, ioquake3 also purports to be a reliable and stable code base on which
to base your game project.

However, before you start compiling your own version of ioquake3, you have to
ask yourself: Have we changed or will we need to change anything of importance
in the engine?

If your answer to this question is "no", it probably makes no sense to build
your own binaries. Instead, you can just use the pre-built binaries on the
website. Just make sure the game is called with:

    +set com_basegame <yournewbase>

in any links/scripts you install for your users to start the game. The
binary must not detect any original quake3 game pak files. If this
condition is met, the game will set com_standalone to 1 and is then running
in stand alone mode.

If you want the engine to use a different directory in your homepath than
e.g. "Quake3" on Windows or ".q3a" on Linux, then set a new name at startup
by adding

    +set com_homepath <homedirname>

to the command line. You can also control which game name to use when talking
to the master server:

    +set com_gamename <gamename>

So clients requesting a server list will only receive servers that have a
matching game name.

Example line:

    +set com_basegame basefoo +set com_homepath .foo
    +set com_gamename foo

If you really changed parts that would make vanilla ioquake3 incompatible with
your mod, we have included another way to conveniently build a stand-alone
binary. Just run make with the option BUILD_STANDALONE=1. Don't forget to edit
the PRODUCT_NAME and subsequent #defines in qcommon/q_shared.h with
information appropriate for your project.

## Standalone game licensing

While a lot of work has been put into ioquake3 that you can benefit from free
of charge, it does not mean that you have no obligations to fulfill. Please be
aware that as soon as you start distributing your game with an engine based on
our sources we expect you to fully comply with the requirements as stated in
the GPL. That includes making sources and modifications you made to the
ioquake3 engine as well as the game-code used to compile the .qvm files for
the game logic freely available to everyone. Furthermore, note that the "QIIIA
Game Source License" prohibits distribution of mods that are intended to
operate on a version of Q3 not sanctioned by id software:

    "with this Agreement, ID grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right
    to distribute copies of the Software ... for operation only with the full
    version of the software game QUAKE III ARENA"

This means that if you're creating a standalone game, you cannot use said
license on any portion of the product. As the only other license this code has
been released under is the GPL, this is the only option.

This does NOT mean that you cannot market this game commercially. The GPL does
not prohibit commercial exploitation and all assets (e.g. textures, sounds,
maps) created by yourself are your property and can be sold like every other
game you find in stores.


## PNG support

ioquake3 supports the use of PNG (Portable Network Graphic) images as
textures. It should be noted that the use of such images in a map will
result in missing placeholder textures where the map is used with the id
Quake 3 client or earlier versions of ioquake3.

Recent versions of GtkRadiant and q3map2 support PNG images without
modification. However GtkRadiant is not aware that PNG textures are supported
by ioquake3. To change this behaviour open the file 'q3.game' in the 'games'
directory of the GtkRadiant base directory with an editor and change the
line:

    texturetypes="tga jpg"

to

    texturetypes="tga jpg png"

Restart GtkRadiant and PNG textures are now available.

## Building with MinGW for pre Windows XP

IPv6 support requires a header named "wspiapi.h" to abstract away from
differences in earlier versions of Windows' IPv6 stack. There is no MinGW
equivalent of this header and the Microsoft version is obviously not
redistributable, so in its absence we're forced to require Windows XP.
However if this header is acquired separately and placed in the qcommon/
directory, this restriction is lifted.

## extra

* About com\_hunkmegs

When i playing CTF on :F for stupid server with default com\_hunkmegs = 128 setting, the following errors occurs:
```
ERROR: Hunk\_Alloc failed on 739360: code/renderergl2/tr\_model.c, line: 535 (sizeof(*v) * (md3Surf->numVerts * md3Surf->numFrames)).
```
OpenGL2 renderer seems use more memory, Upping com\_hunkmegs to 256 will generally be OK.


* About -fno-strict-aliasing
I am using GCC7.2 and clang6.0 on ubuntu18.04.

Build OA using clang with -fno-strict-aliasing removed:
```
WARNING: light grid mismatch, l->filelen=103896, numGridPoints*8=95904
```
This is printed by renderergl2's R_LoadLightGrid function.

    Problem solved with following line added in it.
```
ri.Printf( PRINT_WARNING, "s_worldData.lightGridBounds[i]=%d\n", s_worldData.lightGridBounds[i]);
```
    However this line do nothing but just printed the value of s_worldData.lightGridBounds[i]. I guess its a bug of clang.

    Build OA with GCC without this issue.

* Use gprof to examine the performance of the program
```
gprof openarena.x86_64 gmon.out > report.txt
```
## bugs
* E_AddRefEntityToScene passed a refEntity which has an origin with a NaN component
* Unpure client detected. Invalid .PK3 files referenced!
